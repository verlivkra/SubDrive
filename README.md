# OpenFAST-drivetrain-modeling
A repository containing a description on how to make a coupled turbine-drivetrain model in OpenFAST, and two corresponding models of the DTU 10 MW RWT (monopile and land-based). 

## OpenFAST version and compilation
A version of OpenFAST where SubDyn spring elements are implemented should be used. The models contained in this repository are compatible with the dev-version of OpenFAST v3.5.2 (as of 18th of March 2024). 
The spring elements will likely be available in the OpenFAST v4.0.0 release.
